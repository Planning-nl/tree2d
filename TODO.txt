Move all patching to another level.
Make it a Utils thing.
All type-specific sub-patching should be done there as well (texture, shader, children, etc).
Remove it completely from the core structure (Element, Shader, Texture, etc).

Only use it for testing.

Goal: a simple render tree implementation.

Another option would be to patch a recursive object structure in which patch operations are pre-defined:
{
    children: Base.children({Item: {texture: Base.patch({}), ..., children: }})
}
